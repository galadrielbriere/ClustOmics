Integrating clusterings from : BIC
On datatypes : ['multiomics']
For methods : ['MCCA', 'PINS', 'NEMO', 'SNF', 'rMKL']
Relationship type : BIC_MULTI_MCCA_NEMO_PINS_SNF_rMKL
Optimal number of supports is 4
The graph will be clustered with Louvain clustering using only IntegrationEdges with nb_supports >= 4
619 nodes classified in 5 clusters after remooving too small clusters (min_accepted_nb_nodes_in_clusters set to 8 in the configuration file)
Weighted Modularization Quality for the clustering is 0.6973220200987718
2 unclassified nodes reassigned to consensus clusters
[['TCGA.BH.A1FN.01' '443']
 ['TCGA.D8.A1JG.01' '614']]
Storing results into the graph
Check the graph with the following Cypher query : 
 MATCH (o:Patient:BIC)-[r:FROM_COMMUNITY]-(c:OptimalNbSupports:BIC:LouvainCommunity:BIC_MULTI_MCCA_NEMO_PINS_SNF_rMKL) RETURN o, r, c
