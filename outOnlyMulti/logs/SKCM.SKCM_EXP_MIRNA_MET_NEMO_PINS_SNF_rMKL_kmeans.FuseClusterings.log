Integrating clusterings from : SKCM
On datatypes : ['expression', 'methylation', 'mirna']
For methods : ['PINS', 'NEMO', 'SNF', 'rMKL', 'kmeans']
Relationship type : SKCM_EXP_MIRNA_MET_NEMO_PINS_SNF_rMKL_kmeans
Optimal number of supports is 9
The graph will be clustered with Markov clustering using only IntegrationEdges with nb_supports >= 9
344 nodes classified in 7 clusters after remooving too small clusters (min_accepted_nb_nodes_in_clusters set to 8 in the configuration file)
Weighted Modularization Quality for the clustering is 0.3397765422922608
7 unclassified nodes reassigned to consensus clusters
