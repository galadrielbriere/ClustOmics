Integrating clusterings from : SKCM
On datatypes : ['expression', 'methylation', 'mirna']
For methods : ['PINS', 'NEMO', 'SNF', 'rMKL', 'kmeans']
Relationship type : SKCM_EXP_MIRNA_MET_NEMO_PINS_SNF_rMKL_kmeans_all
Optimal number of supports is 8
The graph will be clustered with Markov clustering using only IntegrationEdges with nb_supports >= 8
345 nodes classified in 6 clusters after remooving too small clusters (min_accepted_nb_nodes_in_clusters set to 17 in the configuration file)
Weighted Modularization Quality for the clustering is 0.34504858165196195
23 unclassified nodes reassigned to consensus clusters
